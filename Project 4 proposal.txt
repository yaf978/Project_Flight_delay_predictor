Our group project will be focused on analyzing flight data from Airlines and Airports within the United States to see if there are correlations and predictions 
on flight delays based on Destination//Arrival Airport, the day of the week, and the Airline chosen.

We'll be incorporating Python - Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn and a variety of packages including Seaborn to help train and scale our data to find answers.
We also plan to incorporate Tableau to provide visually-appealing dashboards to also help tell our story on whether we can predict a delay.

Kaggle links for consideration include:
